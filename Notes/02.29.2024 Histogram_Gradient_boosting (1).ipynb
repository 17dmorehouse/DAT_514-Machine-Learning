This is a modest loss in resolution, but a huge gain in speed,  particularly with very large data sets.\n","\n","Histogram based trees can also work with missing data without having to resort to imputation,  the missing data is simply assigned to a specific bin.  The algorithm places the missing bin on either side of each split point and is assigned to the size that produces the greatest improvement in the loss.\n","\n","You do not need to one-hot encode categorical variables,  it will run with integer categories.\n","\n","Like other tree methods,  it may be used for regression or classification\n","\n","There is an implementation of the Histogram Gradient Boost in SciKit Learn:\n","\n","https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#histogram-based-gradient-boosting\n","\n","The original Histogram based Gradient Boost was produced by Microsoft and distributed as the LightGBM package.    The Microsoft LightGBM can be used from within Python, DASK, or R, or as a stand-alone piece of software.   It looks like the the Sci Kit Learn histogram GB is in fact just an API to the Microsoft code.\n","\n","It does look like you can configure the Micrsoft LightGBM to train models on a GPU,   this would be a reason to consider using the original Microsoft code instead of running it though the Scikit learn inferface.\n","\n","Checked
