Remember that we can use trees for classification or for regression,   the same basic algorithm handles both situations\n","easily.\n","\n","We know that trees are highly prone to overfitting, so averaging over many trees may help greatly to control overfitting.    Ensemble methods may really help in this\n","case.\n","\n","The other issue with trees is that we are using an optimality algorithm that is guaranteed to find the best splitting point at each individual split point in the tree.  \n","However if there is a lot of correlation in the predictors,   we don't know what the other possible \"good\" trees look like.   Minor changes at each branch might also give\n","us pretty good trees.\n","\n","Note that when we say \"best tree at each splitting point\" it really means \"the best tree that fits the training data\",   it might not be the best tree for the\n","cross validation data, or the test data or new data that comes into our business.  \n","\n","In practice, we need to limit the complexity of a tree to keep it from overfitting.   The tree that is most closely matched to the training data is probably not the\n","best for predicting results for new data.   We need to use a simpler tree,  or the average over many complicated trees.    The idea here is to generate a bunch of\n","slightly different trees, that make use of different combinations of the predictors and then average over them.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"9346851b-cfcb-48a1-9eb9-348a342ff0e9","metadata":{"id":"9346851b-cfcb-48a1-9eb9-348a342ff0e9"},"source":["Sources-\n","\n","See Chapter 7 of \"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn,  Keras and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition\" by Geron,   published by O'Reilly\n","\n","Also see the scikit learn website"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"29a211b8-fa83-4633-82eb-fefb4f9972ed","metadata":{"id":"29a211b8-fa83-4633-82eb-fefb4f9972ed"},"source":["## Bagging\n","\n","The random forest model uses a tactic called \"Bagging\" which stands for Bootstrap Aggregation\n","\n","There are a number of ways to carry out a bootstrapping resampling of a data set.\n","\n","In a bootstrapping of specimens or individuals (rows in a data frame),   we randomly pick N rows out of a data frame.\n","\n","This is called sampling.   We can do sampling \"without replacement\" in which each row can appear only once in the boostrap set.    If we sample 100 rows out of 1000,\n","each resampled set will be slightly different.

Resampling with replacement can be\n","used to produce resampled sets the same size as the original set, which will be different from the original sets.    In a way,  resampling with replacement is like\n","fitting a model with different and variable weights on each specimen.   Some specimens have double or triple (or more) weighting,  while others have zero weight.\n","\n","Bootstrapping with replacement generally works better than without replacment.    A bootstrap aggregration without replacement is called \"pasting\"\n","\n","Note that it is also possible to bootstrap variables (columns of a data frame) instead of bootstrapping specimens (rows).
